<div class="story"> 

<p> Coney Island evictions increased 400% in the amusement district over a seven year period. </p>

<p> Luxury high-rise development has caused rent to skyrocket in the area - which has a higher poverty rate than both Brooklyn and NYC's average.   </p> 

<p> “So many renters in New York really struggled during the pandemic, and this caseload has been building in the courts, so now we're finally seeing this come out through data,” Rachel Fee, head of nonprofit policy group New York Housing Conference told Gothamist. </p>

<p> Besides the pandemic, the development surge can also be attributed to pro-development policies like "City of Yes." A 2009 rezoning law enabled the development to take hold in Coney Island, which effectively shrunk the amusement district while increasing residential areas.</p>

<p> "I think it [increased development] probably has more to do with modern market forces than with the rezoning, but maybe it needed to have both to make it happen," said Howard Breuer, journalist and historian who's currently writing a book about the area.<br>
